    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        A community of sites linked to Muizenberg, Capricorn & Vrygrond, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>. 
        Each member includes a badge on their site that links to the previous and next sites in the ring. 
        We are bringing back the free spirit of the 90s, when people used to love the Internet!
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
        To join the webring, <a href="{{ meta.repo }}/pulls">open a pull request</a>
